# Compound

Get to know Compound - the work-in-progress design system for Element. If you're new to Compound - here's a 101 overview of everything you need to know.

## What's Compound?

Compound is the design system for Element. It's a shared language and set of UI component implementations for the web, iOS & Android. Compound is broken down into the following primitives:

* Foundations: Guiding principles which inform the basis of any implementation.
* Styles: Systems for applying colour, type, spacing, sizing and materials.
* Components: Defined components used to build end user experiences.


## Using Compound

While Compound is in early development, the primary consumers of it are the Element core team. Once Compound is mature and use in production, we plan to make as much of it as possible available to the open source community.

The first target codebases for Compound are:

- ElementX, iOS & Android
- Element Web
- Element Call
- Element Admin
- Authentication screens when authenticating using OIDC
