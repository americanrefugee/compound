# Getting started as a designer

Available styles can be found in the [Compound Styles Figma document](https://www.figma.com/file/PpKepmHKGikp33Ql7iivbn/Compound-Styles?node-id=22%3A2763&t=UAtRgYRpQ2xofvM3-1)
They are generated from our set of design tokens.

Themes can be switched using the [Themer Figma plugin](https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/731176732337510831/Themer)

In order to use this plugin, you will need to

- Get the JSONBin access token in your password manager
