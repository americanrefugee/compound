# Getting started as a designer

Styles are documented in the [Compound Styles Figma document](https://www.figma.com/file/PpKepmHKGikp33Ql7iivbn/Compound-Styles?node-id=22%3A2763&t=UAtRgYRpQ2xofvM3-1)

Compound is built on top of design tokens, for convienience you can switch between
themes using the [Themer Figma plugin](https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/731176732337510831/Themer)

Follow these instructions to [setup themer and start using design tokens in your Figma documents](https://github.com/vector-im/compound-design-tokens/blob/develop/docs/sync-tokens.md#%EF%B8%8F-use-tokens-in-a-figma-document)
