#Â Compound Design Tokens

Home to the design tokens.

## Supported platforms

- iOS
- Android
- CSS Properties
- JavaScript (JSON export)

## Development

The tokens are defined under the `tokens/` folder and follow the [W3C Design Tokens specification](https://design-tokens.github.io/community-group/format/).
They are then transformed to the supported platforms using [Style Dictionary](https://amzn.github.io/style-dictionary/).

All consumable tokens are generated under `assets/`. Generate them by running

```
yarn build
```
