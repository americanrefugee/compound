## Development

The tokens are defined under the `tokens/` folder and are synced from [tokens.studio](https://tokens.studio/).
They are then transformed to the supported platforms using [Style Dictionary](https://amzn.github.io/style-dictionary/).

All consumable tokens are generated under `assets/`. Generate them by running

```
yarn build
```
