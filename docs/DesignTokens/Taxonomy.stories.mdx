# üöß WIP

## Design system namespace

All tokens start with the namespace for the design system, `cds`.

## Token tiers

Our design tokens are conceptually divided into three tiers:

- Base
- Semantic
- Components

The top level is global and not aware of context. Subsequent tiers are context-aware, each one being more precise.

Base tokens describe plain values, while semantic tokens describe their purpose in specific contexts. Component tokens describe the intended use in the context of a specific component.

With three kinds of tokens, we can update design decisions globally or apply a change to a single component.

### Base

Used for global, immutable literal values.

Example: `cds.color.blue.800`

### Semantic

Semantic tokens are semantic aliases that map base tokens to specific contexts. They represent the choices in regards to when to use which token.

It allows us to granularly target and control the mapping of base tokens to specific contexts, decoupling it from other contexts that happen to consume the same base token.

Example: `cds.color.background.primary` that points to `cds.color.blue.800`

### Component

Semantic aliases for mapping tokens to component-specific contexts.

Example: `cds.button.color.background.primary` that points to `cds.color.background.primary`

## Token taxonomy

### Namespace

- Design system
  - `cds`
- Theme ‚Äî Define themes by extending and overriding default tokens. Useful for brands, sub-brands, white-labeling, and color schemes.
  - `ees`
- (Domain) ‚Äî Currently unsupported, but reserved for potential future needs. It could be used for specific business units (e.g., `security`).

### Object

- Group ‚Äî For targeting the same property across multiple components.
  - `forms` for defining the border color for input controls (text input, select, checkbox, radio input‚Ä¶).
  - `controls` for controls you interact with like form fields and navigation.
  - `actions` for targeting both buttons and links.
- Component
  - `button`, `input`, `checkbox`, `tooltip`, `modal`‚Ä¶
- Element ‚Äî For targeting elements within a component, similar to [BEM](https://getbem.com/).
  - `icon` within a `button` component.

### Base

- Category
  - `color`, `font`, `border`, `space`, `size`, `shadow`, `elevation`, `opacity`, `breakpoint`, `touch`, `time`
- Property
  - `background`, `text`, `border`, and `icon` for `color` category
  - `family`, `size`, `weight`, `line-height`, and `letter-spacing` for `font` category
  - `width`, `style`, `radius` for `border` category  
- Concept and sub-concepts
  - `feedback`, `action`, and `surface` for `color` category
  - `display`, `heading` and `body` for `font` category 

### Modifier

- Variant ‚Äî Distinguishes alternative use cases.
  - Intent
    - `info`, `success`, `warning`, and `critical` for `feedback` concept
    - `conversion`, `positive`, `negative`, and `neutral` for `action` concept
  - Emphasis ‚Äî Prominence
    - `primary`, `secondary`, and `tertiary` for `action` concept 
- State ‚Äî Properties based on interactive states.
  - `default`, `hovered`, `active`/`pressed`, `focused`, `selected`, `visited`, `disabled`,  `error`
- Scale ‚Äî Choices within a predefined set of values, like varying size, space, shade, and other options.
  - Ordinal: t-shirt sizes (`xxs`, `xs`, `sm`, `md`, `lg`, `xl`, `xxl`‚Ä¶).
  - Sequential/stepped/numerical: base 100 (`100`, `200`, `300`‚Ä¶), base 1/index (`0_5`, `1`, `2`, `4`‚Ä¶)
  - Proportional: `-1x`, `0_5x`, `1x`, `2x`‚Ä¶
  - Keyword/Named:
    - `circle`
    - `regular`, `tight`, `loose`
    - `regular`, `medium`, `semi-bold`, `bold`
    - `sans`, `serif`, `mono`
    - `minimum`
    - `ease-in`, `ease-out`
- Mode ‚Äî Distinguish values across two or more surface/background settings on which elements appear. Use only when there‚Äôs a distinction (e.g., color and shadow for dark theme).
  - `on-light`, `on-dark`, `on-light-hc`, `on-dark-hc`, or any colored surface like `invert`, `on-accent`, `on-primary`, `on-secondary`, `on-surface`.

### Other naming rules

- For compound words, use hyphens to separate the words: `line-height`, `on-primary`, `on-dark-hc`
- For decimal values, replace the decimal point with an underscore: `0_5` for 0.5.
- For negative values, use a hyphen: `-1`.
- ‚ÄúAvoid dogmatically including all levels possible or duplicating token-tuples redundantly. Instead, include only the levels needed to sufficiently describe and distinguish purposeful intent.‚Äù

Exceptions to the rules described in Nathans's article:

- Property comes before Concept and Sub-concept.
